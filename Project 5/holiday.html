    <h1>Holiday Review: Halloween</h1>
    <h2>What is Halloween?</h2>
    <p>Halloween, the spooky holiday that takes place in October on the 31st, is a rather old holiday that has evolved tremendously over the years.
        Regardless of how it once was celebrated, it is a fun holiday that many people enjoy for different reasons. For some, they like the candy, for others, they like
        the decorations, perhaps some people even like the music, alongside many other reasons one may choose to enjoy Halloween. But aspects of the listed attributes of Halloween
        attract people to them? Is it the thrill of fear, the joy of creativity, or the simple pleasure of indulging in sweets? Each person's answer may vary, but the essence of Halloween
        lies in its ability to bring people together in a shared experience of fun and festivity.
    </p>
    <h3>Candy</h3>

    <p>One appealing aspect of Halloween that cannot be denied is the excess of candy. From chocolate bars to gummy worms, the variety of sweets available during this time is truly remarkable.
        A person with a sweet tooth's heaven if will. Whether you are buying a big variety bag just for yourself, sharing with friends, giving it away to trick-or-treaters and saving the rest
    for yourself there is bound to be something for everyone. It's not just people who like Halloween candy but companies as well. Like any other time a holiday spikes interest in particular
    product, chocolate and flowers for Valnetines Day for example, candy companies go all in with Halloween themed candy like pumpkin shaped chocolatees or various Halloween symbol shaped candy.
    Another way candy companies cash in on Halloween candy is by producing large varity bags that people can buy and put in a candy bowl for trick-or-treaters. This is more a less a win-win for
    the candy companies and the consumers because the candy companies make money and the consumers get a easy large bowl of candy to give out.</p>
    <h3>Decorations</h3>

    <p> Another big aspect, and one that I'm partial to, is the decorations that start to show up the spooky season rolls around. There are many kinds of style of decor when it comes to Halloween.
        Some choose to the cute route with more friendly decorations that are for all ages. These can consist of pumpkins carved with cute or silly faces, friendly ghosts, litlle cartoon monsters,
        bright colors, and more. The other main route someone can go is the scary route. There is number of ways this can be done of course, but they all might include darker colors, more realistic
        elements, and be overall more frightening and detailed.
    </p>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <img src="/images/music.jpg" alt="Music" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
    <p>Like the other big holiday in the states, Christmas, Halloween has some of its iconic songs. These can range from classic childhood Halloween songs like "Monster Mash" to older songs like "Thriller".
    A personal newer favorites of mine are Mannheim Steamroller's Halloween music and Splatoon 3's Deepers Creepers day one and two.
