            <h2> Intro to Genshin Impact</h2>
            <p>The world of Genshin Impact is vast and has rich environments that all tell a story. Some
               environments are rich with greenery or have a lack of it, places filled with people living, and
               places that are abandoned for one reason or another. Every environment tells a different
               story; some are more complex, and others are simpler. Regardless of whether they are
               complex or simple, they are all unique in their own ways. This is important because each
               environment has its own story and can allow the player to feel more immersed in the world.
               On this website, some environments will be briefly explored, so be warned, there are some
               spoilers ahead. I would also like to disclose, for those who might care, that I do not engage
               with the larger fandom and, as such, do not agree with the negative actions they
               sometimes partake in.
