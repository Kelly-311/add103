    <h2>Nod Krai</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>Nod Krai is the new region being added, the main inspiration for this region is countries from the Baltic Sea and Celtic Mythology. The story of Nod Krai is set up to be grand in nature with 11
        different factions present and converging in the story, some of the main ones being the <strong>Fatui, the Frost Moon Scions, The Knights of Favonius, Adventurers Guild, and more</strong>. One of the central characters
        of Nod Krai will be Colombina also known as Damselette, is the Moon Maiden, who will serve as one the main drivers for the plot and while mystery around her is still present, we will undoubtedly learn more about her as the story progresses.</p>

    <h3>Genshin Impact: Colombina</h3>
    <p>It may be a few versions before she is playable, as she is expected to come out in 6.3 according to other players.
        There is some speculation that she may be a Cryo, the ice element, or hydro, the water element, and a Catalyst, the mage class type, whether she is a main damage dealer, support, or sub damage dealer is up in the air but regardless of her role she is sure to be a very strong unit.<br>
        <q>Nod Krai is actually the Damselette's homeland the place where she was born...right now for certain reasons, The Damselette has left the Fatui and is currently hiding somewhere near Hiisi Island</q><br>
